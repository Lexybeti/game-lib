# game-lib
A project that can storage and manage a game library

This project works with two main classes: GameLib and Game.

The Game class can storage the game information, like: name, developer and gender. And the GameLib can create the games itself, even show the menus - the list, basically.

And, finally, in the Main class the magic works. We have the starter menu, that shows all the options: addGame, addToWishList, etc. I added a try-catch for this section, to make sure that the client will use a valid number to inform the selection.

In this stage of the project, it only storage the games when you're using the application. In the future, I'll add a Data Base to storage the informations forever. I have the idea to make this application work like a back-end for a website, but it's just an idea for now.
However, this app can work on any computer, since Java has been installed.
