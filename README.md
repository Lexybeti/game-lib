# game-lib
A project that can storage and manage a game library

This project works with two main classes: GameLib and Game.

The Game class can storage the game information, like: name, developer and gender. And the GameLib can create the games itself, even show the menus - the list, basically.

And, finally, in the Main class the magic works. We have the starter menu, that shows all the options: addGame, addToWishList, etc. I added a try-catch for this section, to make sure that the client will use a valid number to inform the selection.

In this stage of the project, it only storage the games when you're using the application. In the future, I'll add a Data Base to storage the informations forever. I have the idea to make this application work like a back-end for a website, but it's just an idea for now.
However, this app can work on any computer, since Java has been installed.

This is the project main menu. It's show all the options that you can choose.

In this example I choosed the first option, to add a game to my library.
The program will show a few informations that you need to tell about the game. The name, developer and the gender.
After this, it will show a message indicate that your game has bee added in your library.

Whatever option you choosed, after all the information a message saying "Press enter to continue..." will show. That's a method inside the project to make you feel more comfortable to read all the informations.

For now, when you choose "Show all lists", they will show like this. By the way, if your game has been added in your wishlist and you want to add to your library, the program will remove it from wishlist. That's works like you alreay buy the game.

New updates soon!
